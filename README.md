# python-image-recognition

I had created an image sorter with Google Vision, but I don't know where that Python code is. I'll probably write a new one for Google Vision. So, this one currently uses 
[AWS Rekognition](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/dg/images-bytes.html). The [move_files.py](https://github.com/hxrsmurf/python-image-recognition/blob/master/move_files.py) is the basic navigate sub-folders and move all of the files to the root directory.
